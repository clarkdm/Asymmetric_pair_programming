# Asymmetric_pair_programming

The aim was to allow a group of programmers to work together and always be able to see the most
up-to-date version of the code without all crowding round one computer. This is done by having
HTML clients interacting with a server program written in Java .The server makes sure that the
code displayed on clients’ screen is always up to date and enables users to view other user's’
cursor positions, to aid in identifying the sections of code that are being discussed.
